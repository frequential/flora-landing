## Want to contribute with your knowledge?
Awesome! Your work makes this project reach more people, but before committing a contribution, it's a good practice to create an issue in the [issues section](https://github.com/JasperEdits/Flora/issues) or search if there's already one that is already being taken care of.
### Don't see an issue?
